# Module 10 Express Docker


## Exercise 1 -

Try creating your own EC2 ubuntu instance on AWS, following the steps in the previous
slides. Remember to create only a free tier server so that AWS does not charge you
anything for your instance.

docker pull marcalmarcal/minimal_app

## Exercise 2 -

Try hosting the docker image of your NodeJS application that you previously configured to
use GitHub actions to deploy on DockerHub.
Share the link of your hosted application to your trainer.

## Exercise 3 - 

Try hosting the GitHub repo of a NodeJS application that you have already created, using
AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Choose a standalone repository with no dependencies on a database.
Share the link of your hosted application with your trainer.
